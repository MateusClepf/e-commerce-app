# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the e-commerce backend application to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
- Enforces token expiration to limit session lifetime
- Implements environment-based secret configuration
- Never exposes the token secret in the codebase

### Authorization Middleware
- `auth.js`: Verifies the JWT token and attaches user data to the request
- `admin.js`: Verifies the user has admin privileges
- `resourceOwnerOrAdmin.js`: Verifies the user owns the resource or is an admin

## Input Validation

### Request Validation
- Uses Joi for schema-based validation of all user inputs
- Validates data structure, types, and values
- Prevents malformed data from reaching business logic
- Returns detailed validation error messages

### SQL Injection Protection
- Primary defense: Uses Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries
- Secondary defense: Additional middleware to detect SQL injection patterns
- Blocks or logs suspicious request patterns
- Uses defensive coding practices throughout the codebase

## Other Security Measures

### Error Handling
- Global error handler to prevent leaking sensitive information
- Different error responses in development vs. production
- Structured error logging for monitoring and alerts

### Rate Limiting
- Limits the number of requests from a single IP
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Different limits for sensitive operations (login, etc.)

### Secure Headers
- Sets appropriate security headers
- Prevents common attacks like XSS, clickjacking, etc.

## Implementing Security in Routes

### Example of a Secure Route

```javascript
// Create product - admin only with validation and SQL injection protection
router.post(
  '/',
  auth,                       // 1. Authenticate the user
  admin,                      // 2. Verify admin privileges
  validateRequest(schema),    // 3. Validate the request body
  sqlInjectionProtection(),   // 4. Check for SQL injection patterns
  productController.create    // 5. Handle the request
);
```

### Resource Ownership Example

```javascript
// Update resource - only owner or admin
router.put(
  '/:id',
  validateRequest(idSchema, 'params'),
  auth,
  resourceOwnerOrAdmin(getResourceOwnerId),
  controller.update
);
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly run `npm audit` and update packages
   - Monitor security advisories for used libraries

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use different secrets for different environments

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - Validate all inputs at the API boundary
   - Apply context-specific validation (e.g., HTML sanitization for rich text)
   - Be defensive about unexpected input formats

4. **Database Security**
   - Use least privilege principles for database access
   - Implement proper indexing to prevent DoS attacks
   - Sanitize all database inputs, even when using an ORM

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Avoid logging sensitive information
   - Implement monitoring for suspicious patterns

## Security Testing

- Implement unit tests for security mechanisms
- Use tools like OWASP ZAP for automated vulnerability scanning
- Conduct regular security code reviews
- Consider bug bounty programs for production systems
